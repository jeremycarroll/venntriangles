Search for Venn diagrams of six triangles


# Lemmas used in the code

## For a simple FISC of N Curves, there are 2 ^ N - 2 vertices, and 2 ^ (N + 1) - 4 edges.

By Euler:
```
Euler:
E = F + V - 2

F = 2 ^ N

From simplicity, every edge has two vertices, and every vertix has four edges:
E = 2 V

2.V = 2 ^ N + V - 2

and the result follows.
```
